[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a fantastic package manager for macOS and Linux. I release some of my projects via Homebrew as it is widely used and easy to deploy to. This tap is a "self hosted" collection of Homebrew packages. For specific details about a formula contained in this tap, visit that formula's homepage or see the table below.

This repos is completely automated and maintained via [Justintime50/homebrew-releaser](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/homebrew-releaser). If you are looking for a way to publish your own Homebrew formula on your behalf, you should check it out!
